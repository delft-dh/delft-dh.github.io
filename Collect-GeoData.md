### Data Conversion
Converting data types can be very handy. For example, in order to use GML data in Python with the geopandas library, we need to [convert it to GeoJSON format](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/77974/converting-gml-to-geojson-using-python-and-ogr-with-geometry-transformation).
