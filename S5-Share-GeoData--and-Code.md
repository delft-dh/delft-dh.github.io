## Data and Code Repositories

### 4TU.ResearchData

From [researchdata.4tu.nl](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/about/organisation/): "4TU.ResearchData is an international data repository for science, engineering and design. Its services include curation, sharing, long-term access and preservation of research datasets. These services are available to anyone around the world. In addition, 4TU.ResearchData also offers training and resources to researchers to support them in making research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible (FAIR).

To ensure accurate citation and to ensure that other researchers will be able to retrieve your dataset in the future, datasets must be equipped with one or more identifiers (preferably a persistent identifier). Every dataset in 4TU.ResearchData archive is provided with a unique, persistent Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which can be linked to or cited in publications.

While you are writing your article, you may reserve a DOI for the data to which you wish to link and that you plan to store in an archive in 4TU.ResearchData. The DOI will be activated once your dataset has been published."

### DataVerseNL
From [researchdata.4tu.nl](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/use/manage-share/): "Members of the three technical universities (Eindhoven, Twente and Delft) can draw upon DataverseNL through 4TU.ResearchData. The objective of this open source application is to make research data accessible to others. You can store data in the DataverseNL environment and grant multiple individuals controlled access to them. Once you have requested the project environment or dataverse from 4TU.ResearchData, you are free to arrange this environment as you wish."

### Zenodo

From [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/): "Built and developed by researchers, to ensure that everyone can join in Open Science. The OpenAIRE project, in the vanguard of the open access and open data movements in Europe was commissioned by the EC to support their nascent Open Data policy by providing a catch-all repository for EC funded research. CERN, an OpenAIRE partner and pioneer in open source, open access and open data, provided this capability and Zenodo was launched in May 2013.

Every upload is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), to make them citable and trackable."

### TU Delft GitLab
TU Delft has its own instance of GitLab at tudelft.gitlab.nl. 

From [tudelft.nl](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/collect-and-document): "GitLab, Gitlab.tudelft.nl, is an online Git repository management tool with a wiki, issue tracker, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment built-in. The service is intended for researchers. It is a TU Delft provided version control system with backup facility, particularly useful for working with code and software. Access to external collaborators can be provided.

Similar services are, for example, GitHub.com or GitLab.com. In contrast to these services, GitLab TU Delft is hosted by the TU Delft itself, on campus.  You can create a GitLab repository yourself at https://gitlab.tudelft.nl. More information and a form to request access for external users can be found at [Top Desk](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=888da653ddc04d01b2d5db413fc99a42)."
