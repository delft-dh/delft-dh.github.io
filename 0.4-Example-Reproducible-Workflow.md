## Reproducibility

There is a need to transition to improve transparency and reproducibility in reporting GIS research results. See this presentation by Phil Hurvitz at the University of Washington: http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/images/reproducible_gis_csde_20200212a.pptm

(Make an image to go with this)

1. Pull data from repository or source 
2. Organize data folder with raw data (read only), analysis scripts (read/write), plots (write only) and documentation (read/write)
3. Initialize git repository
4. Initialize DVC
5. Pull data into analysis program of choice
6. Perform analyses and produce outputs (make path to outputs separate folder)
7. Publish data and code (GitLab/Hub, 4TU, other)
- if 4TU, will mint a DOI used for citation, can integrate with GitHub
- create metadata according to domain standards, document meaning of variables, units, CRSs
- README.md file contains all info someone would need to reproduce your analyses on their own data
