## Reproducibility

There is a need to transition to improve transparency and reproducibility in reporting GIS research results. As stated by Phil Hurvitz at the University of Washington: "Whereas desktop GIS packages are great applications for exploratory spatial data analysis and generation of map graphics, with typical work flows they are limited for scientific research. **If you can’t remember, reproduce, or clearly communicate your methodology, then what you are doing cannot be technically called “research.”** Both ArcGIS Desktop and QGIS, two leading desktop GIS applications, employ the use of Python for scripting geoprocessing analyses and user interfaces."

Learning how to work in Python or another programming language like R requires commitment and time to master. However, because these are highly useful and open-source tools that have applications in a broad array of disciplines, there is a plethora of knowledge available to help get started and troubleshoot challenges you run into. Fundamentally, the goal of transitioning to a code-based analysis workflow is to increase the reproducibility of your research results, which is increasingly required by publishers and just good practice in the scientific realm.

(Make an image to go with this)

1. Pull data from repository or source 
2. Organize data folder with raw data (read only), analysis scripts (read/write), plots (write only) and documentation (read/write)
3. Initialize git repository
4. Initialize DVC
5. Pull data into analysis program of choice
6. Perform analyses and produce outputs (make path to outputs separate folder)
7. Publish data and code (GitLab/Hub, 4TU, other)
- if 4TU, will mint a DOI used for citation, can integrate with GitHub
- create metadata according to domain standards, document meaning of variables, units, CRSs
- README.md file contains all info someone would need to reproduce your analyses on their own data
