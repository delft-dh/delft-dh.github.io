# About this wiki
Our aim with this wiki is to articulate the Data Wheel framework into a set of workflows and tools that help researchers to realize each component of this general framework. We are defining and recommending processes and tools for different phases of the research workflow. These include geographic and historic data collection, data verification, data publishing, as well as analysis, source management, and other aspects.
