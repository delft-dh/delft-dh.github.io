## QGIS
QGIS is a professional GIS application that is built on top of and proud to be itself Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
It is a tool kit and ecosystem composed of different services and functionalities. I can also be extended with plugins, etc.

**Download QGIS:** https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html

**Resources for getting started:**
* https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/index.html
* [General information about QGIS software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS)
* [The QGIS Python Console](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/python_console.html#:~:text=The%20QGIS%20Python%20Console%20is,Ctrl%2BAlt%2BP%20).)
* [Introduction to QGIS Python programming for non-programmers](https://anitagraser.com/pyqgis-101-introduction-to-qgis-python-programming-for-non-programmers/)

### Most common usage scenarios
- Generating data, annotations and preparing it to archive it.
- Working with standalone data in diverse formats.

### The QGIS Python console

"QGIS provides a built-in console where you can type python commands and get the result. This console is a great way to learn scripting and also to do quick data processing. Open the Python Console by going to Plugins ‣ Python Console." - https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/getting_started_with_pyqgis.html 

"The QGIS Python Console is an interactive shell for the python command executions. It also has a python file editor that allows you to edit and save your python scripts. Both console and editor are based on PyQScintilla2 package. To open the console go to Plugins ‣ Python Console (Ctrl+Alt+P)."

* Execute code snippets from the input area by typing and pressing Enter or Run Command

### The Code Editor

"allows editing and saving Python files and offers advanced functionalities to manage your code (comment and uncomment code, check syntax, share the code via codepad.org and much more)."

## GRASS GIS
Commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System), it is a FOSS-GIS software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world, as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting companies. It is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). GRASS GIS can be installed along with and made accessible within QGIS 3.

## SAGA-GIS
Or System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses, is a FOSS-GIS application developed by a small team of researchers from the Dept. of Physical Geography, Göttingen, and the Dept. of Physical Geography, Hamburg. SAGA has been designed for an easy and effective implementation of spatial algorithms, offers a comprehensive, growing set of geoscientific methods, provides an easily approachable user interface with many visualisation options, and runs under Windows and Linux operating systems. Like GRASS GIS, it can also be installed and made accessible in QGIS3.

## Python
Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. Python is powerful and fast, plays well with others, runs everywhere, is friendly & easy to learn and is Open Source.

The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of third-party modules for Python. Both Python's standard library and the community-contributed modules allow for endless possibilities. [Link](https://www.python.org)

**Anaconda** is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. [Link](https://www.anaconda.com)

**NOTE:** if you have installed QGIS, you already have a working installation of Python on your system. All you need to get started is to launch QGIS and open the Python console (Plugins > Python console).

## R and RStudio
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. 

R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS. [Link](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

**RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. [Link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
