# Research and Data management roles
Researchers are increasingly using data science for all kinds of research purposes. They also generate data, publish it and frequently also process it in some form. In many cases data is processed using some kind of scripting, programming from beginners level to advanced levels. It is in this context related to data management, analysis, publishing and making the analysis reproducible researchers can benefit from FAIR practices for data and software.

## Common roles and activities related to research data management and software
> Disclaimer: Roles can be played by one person. Roles can also be shared among team members. For instance reviewing a shared inbox can be a shared role, while a researcher can also play the role of a software engineer, or project manager. Therefore not all roles described need to fit only one person.

### Common activities
**Generating data**: Involves the general data generation activities in the context of GIS from georeferencing image maps, to annotating maps, selecting standards, etc.

**Publishig data**: Implies archiving, making the data accessible and findable, providing unique identifiers, metadata, citation, etc.

**Accessing data published by others**: Donwloading datasets

**Analizing data**: Using different kinds of workflows, tools and scripting to generate analysis based on GIS data. This involves combining different data sets from different sources, 

#### Basic roles

**Publishers**: Those responsible for publishing the research and making it available respecting specific standards.

**Users** : Users of data can be colleagues from your own research group or external anonymous researchers, that have access to the data published.

**Research developers**: Researchers, or staff that generates code, analysis or libraries using computer programs to improve or enable certain research tasks.

### Advanced roles
**Product owners**: This is  a specific role in software projects which involves researching about use cases, collecting use cases that are valid and representative of the user community. It requires certain training on how to generate specifications and maintain clear project scope. In the context of research a domain expert with some technical culture can be a good product owner.

**Maintainers:** When certain projects are big, are used by a community and needs systematic updates, maintainers are needed so that the project stays alive. Maintanance activities varies based on projects. It can be documentation maintanance, code library maintanance, or devops activities.

**Software engineer**: Focuses on feasibility, selecting proper technology stack that fits the requirements normally specified by product owners. 

**Research Software Engineer**: This role has emerged in Universities as a recognition to researchers that end up doing more programming and software related activities than conventional research. Normally they tend to be researchers former PhD or Master students with a domain backround and a technical background that combined can support research groups with tasks related to software and data management.

**Project manager/Scrum master**: It is someone focused on making sure that the development collaborates, is not overloaded and constantly checks for achievements, limitations, and deadlines. He/she is also responsible of making sure that developers commit to tasks they can deliver. 

**RSE and RDM Trainer/Mentor**: These roles are people within your community or institution that can support you with training on FAIR best practices, Research Software Engineering and Data Management. They should help you in getting up to spped with contemporary topics related to how to store data, make reproducible analysis, collaborate with other scientists, share and publish your code. They can also provide in house training related to version control, software development, data science, languages like Python and R, among other tasks.
