# Geodata Open Data sources

### OpenStreetMap
From [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about): "OpenStreetMap provides map data for thousands of web sites, mobile apps, and hardware devices. OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world. OpenStreetMap is open data: you are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon the data in certain ways, you may distribute the result only under the same licence."

### PDOK Open Data

From [pdok.nl](https://www.pdok.nl/): "Public Services On the Map (PDOK) is a platform for accessing geo data sets of Dutch governments. This is current and reliable data for both the public and private sector. PDOK makes digital geo-information available as data services and files. The PDOK services are based on open data and are therefore freely available to everyone. 

At PDOK you will find open data sets from the [Dutch] government with current geo-information. These datasets are accessible via geo web services, RESTful APIs and available as downloads and linked data."

### Open Environmental and Earth Observation data

From [digital-geography.com](https://digital-geography.com/digital-earth-potential-data-brokers/): "Recently there has been a wide spread adoption of Open Access or Open Data policies for environmental and Earth Observation data. With these developments we are seeing a paradigm shift towards a data-centric Environmental Observation Web, where data is semantically enriched thus enabling the consumption, production and reuse of environmental observations in cross-domain applications. We are also seeing the proliferation of data portals and catalogues:

* [The Group on Earth Observations portal (GEOSS)](http://www.geoportal.org/)
* [The EU Commission portal for marine modelling data](http://marine.copernicus.eu/)
* [The Open Data portal of the US Government](https://www.data.gov/)
* [The Open Access data portal of the European Space Agency](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home)


### CBS Open Data

From [opendata.cbs.nl](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=nl&_catalog=CBS): "As the national statistical office, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) provides reliable statistical information and data to produce insight into social issues, thus supporting the public debate, policy development and decision-making while contributing to prosperity, well-being and democracy.

CBS was established in 1899 in response to the need for independent and reliable information that advances the understanding of social issues. This is still the main role of CBS. Through time, CBS has grown into an innovative knowledge institution, with continuous adoption of new technologies and developments in order to safeguard the quality of its data and its independent position."
