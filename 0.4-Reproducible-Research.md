## Reproducibility


As stated by Phil Hurvitz at the University of Washington: "Whereas desktop GIS packages are great applications for exploratory spatial data analysis and generation of map graphics, with typical work flows they are limited for scientific research. **If you can’t remember, reproduce, or clearly communicate your methodology, then what you are doing cannot be technically called “research.”**" See more in [this presentation.](http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/images/reproducible_gis_csde_20200212a.pptm)

Fundamentally, the goal of transitioning to a code-based analysis workflow is to increase the reproducibility of your research results, which is increasingly required by publishers and just good practice in the scientific realm. 

A huge advantage for learning programming is that you have your entire workflow recorded in a central document - a document that can be re-run at will. The benefit of using code to explore and analyse your data is that the code itself helps to make your project reproducible - when stored alongside your data and publication, it is a handy way of openly sharing with other researchers and allowing the potential of reproducibility (a fundamental tenet of not just open science, but all science).

The image below shows a spectrum of reproducibility based on the contents of research outputs.

## Sharing your research data and code
Repositories, like 4TU.ResearchData, Zenodo or GitHub/GitLab are the best way to share data and code.  From [community.data.4tu.nl](https://community.data.4tu.nl/2020/11/21/leons-swan-song/): “Datasets should be recognised as a primary research output, including those that are not linked to an article.” OpenAIRE.eu has published this [guide for researchers on choosing a repository](https://www.openaire.eu/opendatapilot-repository-guide) to share your research outputs in after your project ends.
