## Reproducibility

Fundamentally, the goal of transitioning to a code-based analysis workflow is to increase the reproducibility of your research results, which is increasingly required by publishers and just good practice in the scientific realm.

Learning how to work in Python or another programming language like R requires commitment and time to master. However, because these are highly useful and open-source tools that have applications in a broad array of disciplines, there is a plethora of knowledge available to help get started and troubleshoot challenges you run into. The benefit of using code to explore and analyse your data is that the code itself helps to make your project reproducible - when stored alongside your data and publication, it is a handy way of openly sharing with other researchers and allowing the potential of reproducibility (a fundamental tenet of not just open science, but all science).

This Wiki contains links to learning resources and popular programming libraries and packages (collections of ready-made functions) in geospatial analysis, as well as hands-on demonstrations of how to transition to a more reproducible workflow by collecting, preparing, analysing, visualising and sharing data. See the FAIR data and software section for information on including metadata and documentation to help make your research outputs Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.
