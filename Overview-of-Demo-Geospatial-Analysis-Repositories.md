## WWII Bombings in the Netherlands 

As a historian studying the Netherlands infrastructure damaged in WWII, I would like to analyse the amount of bombs thrown in the Netherlands in the different years of WWII and represent those in a map through time using Jupyter notebooks and geopandas.

Based on this tutorial from the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh#creating-a-python-3-virtual-environment), with a case study of WWII bombings. Is a bit of a rough subject but history is dark :)

The questions we try to answers are related to dropped bombs and ammunitions.

The data source is a .csv file you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/gh-pages/assets/visualizing-with-bokeh/thor_wwii.csv)
