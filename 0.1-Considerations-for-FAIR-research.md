## What is FAIR?
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable/**R**eproducible.

## The FAIR guiding principles: https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18

To be **Findable:**

F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes
F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

To be **Accessible:**

A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol
A1.1. the protocol is free, open and universally implementable
A1.2. the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary
A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

To be **Interoperable:**

I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation
I2. (meta)data uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

To be **Reusable:**

R1. (meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
R1.2. (meta)data are associated with data provenance
R1.3. (meta)data meet domain relevant community standards
