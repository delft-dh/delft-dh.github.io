## What is FAIR?
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable/**R**eproducible.

## Findability

### Examples challenges to Findability

## Accessibility
- The selected standard/format.
- The popularity and adoption of specific tools to read those formats.

### Example challenges to Accessibility 
- Postgrel database, copying database implies replicating it in an environment to access it etc. In this case it is improbable that the person who will reproduce the research will do it.

## Interoperability

### Example challenges to Interoperability
- Formatting issues

### Recommended file formats
- **GeoJSON**
- **GML**

## Reusability/Reproducibility
