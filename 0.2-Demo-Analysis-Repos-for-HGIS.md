## 1. Urban population density by built area

An urbanist interested in space logistics calculates a more accurate value for urban population density based on the total area of built environment within a municipality. The total area of a city includes water, roads, sidewalks etc., but in this case, the researcher is interested in only the area occupied by buildings, i.e., the total ground floor area of all buildings in the city. They use data from the PDOK (built area) and CBS (population size) to find a value of population density per built area. They must convert the PDOK data, which is offered in .gml format, into geoJSON prior to conducting their analysis using Python in a Jupyter notebook.

**Link to Repository:** https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/ddh/dcc-demo-population-density-by-built-area

Concepts illustrated:
* Geospatial file type conversion (GML to GeoJSON)
* Extracting layers by conditional values
* Calculating spatial area by polygon label
* Managing packages (and conflicts) using conda environments

Tools demonstrated:
* Python 
* geopandas for spatial area calculation
* ogr2ogr for data conversion
* Jupyter notebooks

## 2. WWII bombings heat map

A (fictional) historian studying infrastructure damaged in WWII visualises the volume of bombs that landed in countries throughout the world during the war. Data are represented in a heatmap generated by the library ___. All code is available and reproducible from a Jupyter notebook.

**Link to Repository:** https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/ddh/dcc-demo-wwii-bombings

Concepts illustrated:
- Tracking changes to dataset(s) using Data Version Control (DVC)
- Version control with Git
- Data cleaning
- Creating a custom heatmap
- Checking and matching CRSs between data layers

Tools demonstrated:
- Python
- Geopandas (Python library for geospatial data)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git
- DVC

Based on this tutorial from the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh#creating-a-python-3-virtual-environment), with a case study of WWII bombings. Is a bit of a rough subject but history is dark :)

The questions we try to answers are related to dropped bombs and ammunitions.

The data source is a .csv file you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/gh-pages/assets/visualizing-with-bokeh/thor_wwii.csv).
