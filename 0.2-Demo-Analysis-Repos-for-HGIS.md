## 1. WWII bombings by country

As a historian studying the Netherlands infrastructure damaged in WWII, I would like to analyse the amount of bombs thrown in the Netherlands in the different years of WWII and represent those in a map through time using Jupyter notebooks and geopandas.

**Link to Repository:** https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/ddh/dcc-demo-wwii-bombings

Concepts illustrated:
- Tracking changes to dataset(s) using Data Version Control (DVC)
- Version control with Git
- Data cleaning
- Creating a custom heatmap
- Checking and matching CRSs between data layers

Tools demonstrated:
- Python
- Geopandas (Python library for geospatial data)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git
- DVC

Based on this tutorial from the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh#creating-a-python-3-virtual-environment), with a case study of WWII bombings. Is a bit of a rough subject but history is dark :)

The questions we try to answers are related to dropped bombs and ammunitions.

The data source is a .csv file you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/gh-pages/assets/visualizing-with-bokeh/thor_wwii.csv).

## 2. Polygon Area Overlap 

"Between the 10 datasets that are loaded, which two show the most, or least, similarity in spatial patterns?" 

Calculate degree to which polygons in n spatial datasets overlap

Concepts illustrated:
- Spatial calculations


Tools demonstrated:
- Python
- ArcPy (Python library)
- Jupyter notebooks

	- percentage of overlap, and given the total area (i.e., the sum of the polygons’ area), you can derive the actual area of the overlapping zone

## 3. Refine population density by built area in Rotterdam

The research question: can we link population for the Dutch city of Rotterdam to the built area in the city plans? 

Often, the total area of the city is used to calculate population density, but the total area also includes water, roads, green areas, etc. In the use case, we only combine the built-up area attribute with the population and thus calculate the 'real' population density.

**Link to Repository:** 

Concepts illustrated:
- Geospatial file type conversion (GML to GeoJSON)
- Extracting layers by conditional values
- Calculating spatial area by polygon label

Tools demonstrated:
- Python
- OGR
- Jupyter notebooks
- 

- import data from TOP10NL_37O.gml file (land use classifications)
	- try converting from GML to GeoJSON using [Converting gml to geojson using Python and ogr with geometry transformation? - Geographic Information Systems Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/77974/converting-gml-to-geojson-using-python-and-ogr-with-geometry-transformation)
		- the ESPG is 4326 - WGS 84
	- Select Gebouw layer, all building types or maybe try to leave out ones that are not meant for living (‘brander’)
	- Calculate spatial area of all polygons in Gebouw layer
	- Use Bevolking file with pop data to calculate real pop dense (write function)
