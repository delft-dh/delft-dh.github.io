## Here we should explain how to request and generate ideas to improve the HGIS DM workflow

### Example of a use case:
As a historian studying the Netherlands infrastructure damaging in WW2, I would like to analyze the amount of bombs thrown in the Netherlands in the different years of wwII and represent those in a map through time using jupyter notebooks and geopandas.

I came across this tutorial from the [historian programmer](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh#creating-a-python-3-virtual-environment), with a case anaylisis of world war bombings. Is a bit of a rough subject but history is dark :)

I really encourage @ybcvanmil and @thomasvandenbr to follow this tutorial:

## Going further with HGIS

The question the try to answers are related to dropped bombs and amuninitions.

## Is there a question related to geographical data that we can ask?
- which were the most bombed regions?
- How much tons of bombs were thrown?

The data source is a csv file you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/gh-pages/assets/visualizing-with-bokeh/thor_wwii.csv)
