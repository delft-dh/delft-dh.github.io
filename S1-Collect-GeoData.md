## Geodata Open Data sources

### OpenStreetMap
OpenStreetMap is a great open-source map of the world that can give us some insight into these and similar questions. 
To access the Overpass API with Python use the overpy package as a wrapper.

### Open Environmental and Earth Observation data

Recently there has been a wide spread adoption of Open Access or Open Data policies for environmental and Earth Observation data. With these developments we are seeing a paradigm shift towards a data-centric Environmental Observation Web, where data is semantically enriched thus enabling the consumption, production and reuse of environmental observations in cross-domain applications. We are also seeing the proliferation of data portals and catalogues:

* http://www.geoportal.org/ : The Group on Earth Observations portal (GEOSS).
* http://marine.copernicus.eu/ : The EU Commission portal for marine modelling data.
* https://www.data.gov/ : The Open Data portal of the US Government.
* https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home : The Open Access data portal of the European Space Agency
