## Geodata Open Data sources

### OpenStreetMap
OpenStreetMap is a great open-source map of the world that can give us some insight into these and similar questions. 
To access the Overpass API with Python use the overpy package as a wrapper.

### Open Environmental and Earth Observation data

Recently there has been a wide spread adoption of Open Access or Open Data policies for environmental and Earth Observation data. With these developments we are seeing a paradigm shift towards a data-centric Environmental Observation Web, where data is semantically enriched thus enabling the consumption, production and reuse of environmental observations in cross-domain applications. We are also seeing the proliferation of data portals and catalogues:

* http://www.geoportal.org/ : The Group on Earth Observations portal (GEOSS).
* http://marine.copernicus.eu/ : The EU Commission portal for marine modelling data.
* https://www.data.gov/ : The Open Data portal of the US Government.
* https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home : The Open Access data portal of the European Space Agency

### CBS Open Data

"As the national statistical office, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) provides reliable statistical information and data to produce insight into social issues, thus supporting the public debate, policy development and decision-making while contributing to prosperity, well-being and democracy.

CBS was established in 1899 in response to the need for independent and reliable information that advances the understanding of social issues. This is still the main role of CBS. Through time, CBS has grown into an innovative knowledge institution, with continuous adoption of new technologies and developments in order to safeguard the quality of its data and its independent position."
