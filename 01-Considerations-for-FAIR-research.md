# What is FAIR research?
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable/**R**eproducible.

## Considerations for Findability

### Examples challenges related to Findability

## Considerations for Accessibility
- The selected standard/format.
- The popularity and adoption of specific tools to read those formats.

### Example challenges related to Accessibility 
- Postgrel database, copying database implies replicating it in an environment to access it etc. In this case it is improbable that the person who will reproduce the research will do it.

## Considerations for Interoperability

### Example challenges related to Interoperability
- Formatting issues

### Recommended file formats
- **GeoJSON**
- **GML**

## Considerations for Reusability/Reproducibility

### Example challenges related to Reusability/Reproducibility
